   - `photo`
   - `region`
   - `fact`
   - `photoCredit`
   - `audioCredit`
   - copyright fields (optional)
5. Commit your changes
6. Submit a **Pull Request**

## Rules

- **Do not modify any file except `species-data.js`**
- Filenames must exactly match your uploaded image/audio files
- Photos and audio must include proper credits
- Facts should be 1–2 sentences and scientifically accurate
- Regions should be short and consistent (e.g. "Eastern U.S.")

All contributions will be reviewed before merging.
