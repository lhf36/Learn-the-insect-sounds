# Contributing to the Insect Song Learning Game

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

This project limits direct editing to protect the game code.  
You may propose new species by editing **only** the `species-data.js` file.

## How to add a new species

1. **Fork this repository** (look this up if you don't know what it means) 
2. Open `species-data.js`
3. Copy the template object at the bottom of the file
4. Fill in:
   - `commonName`
   - `species`
   - `spectrogramImage`
   - `audio`
   - `photo`
   - `region`
   - `fact`
   - `photoCredit`
   - `audioCredit`
   - copyright fields (optional)
5. Commit your changes
6. Submit a **Pull Request**
7. Add the files for photo, audio, and spectrogram image to the images and audio folders.
   -   Make sure file names match `spectrogramImage`,`audio`, and `photo` names.
   -   All files should be creative commons licensed.
## Rules

- **Do not modify any file except `species-data.js`**
- Filenames must exactly match your uploaded image/audio files
- Photos and audio must include proper credits
- Facts should be 1–2 sentences and scientifically accurate
- Regions should be short and consistent (e.g. "Eastern United States")

All contributions will be reviewed before merging.

Thank you for helping expand the species list!
